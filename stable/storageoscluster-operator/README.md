# StorageOSCluster Helm Chart

[StorageOS](https://storageos.com) is a software-based storage platform designed for cloud-native applications.  By
deploying StorageOS on your Kubernetes cluster, local storage from cluster node is aggregated into a distributed pool,
and persistent volumes created from it using the native Kubernetes volume driver are available instantly to pods
wherever they move in the cluster.

Features such as replication, encryption and caching help protect data and maximise performance.


## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.8+ with Beta APIs enabled
- Kubernetes must be configured to allow:
    - Privileged mode containers (enabled by default)
    - Feature gate: MountPropagation=true.  This can be done by appending `--feature-gates MountPropagation=true` to the
      kube-apiserver and kubelet services.

Refer to the [StorageOS prerequisites docs](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/install/prerequisites/) for more information.


## Installing the chart

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/storageos/storageoscluster-operator-helm-chart.git
$ cd storageoscluster-operator-helm-chart
$ helm install --namespace storageos-operator --name my-release .
```

This will install the StorageOSCluster operator with release name `my-release`
in `storageos-operator` namespace.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`


## Creating a StorageOS cluster

Create a secret to store storageos cluster secrets:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: "storageos-api"
  namespace: "default"
  labels:
    app: "storageos"
type: "kubernetes.io/storageos"
data:
  # echo -n '<secret>' | base64
  apiAddress: c3RvcmFnZW9zOjU3MDU=
  apiUsername: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  apiPassword: c3RvcmFnZW9z
```

Create a `StorageOSCluster` custom resource and refer the above secret in
`secretRefName` and `secretRefNamespace` fields.

```yaml
apiVersion: "storageos.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "StorageOSCluster"
metadata:
  name: "example-storageos"
  namespace: "default"
spec:
  secretRefName: "storageos-api"
  secretRefNamespace: "default"
```

Once `StorageOSCluster` configuration is applied, the StorageOSCluster operator
would setup a storageos cluster in `storageos` namespace by default.

To enable StorageOS CSI setup, add:
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  csi:
    enable: true
  ...
```
in the above `StorageOSCluster` resource config.

To check cluster status, run:

```
$ kubectl get storageoscluster
NAME                READY     STATUS    AGE
example-storageos   3/3       Running   4m
```

All the events related to this cluster are logged as part of the cluster object
and can be viewed by describing the object.

```
$ kubectl describe storageoscluster example-storageos
Name:         example-storageos
Namespace:    default
Labels:       <none>
...
...
Events:
  Type     Reason         Age              From                       Message
  ----     ------         ----             ----                       -------
  Warning  ChangedStatus  1m (x2 over 1m)  storageoscluster-operator  0/3 StorageOS nodes are functional
  Normal   ChangedStatus  35s              storageoscluster-operator  3/3 StorageOS nodes are functional. Cluster healthy
```

### Setup Automatic Cleanup

The above setup would create storageos data at `/var/lib/storageos`. In order to
setup automatic cleanup when a cluster is deleted, the chart's `cleanup.enable`
must be set to `true` in `values.yaml` before install the chart. This would
install some extra components for automatic cleanup of storageos cluster data.
In addition to that, the StorageOS cluster spec must also have `cleanupAtDelete`
set to `true`. With this set, when a cluster is deleted, the data and
configurations associated with the cluster are also deleted.


## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the StorageOSCluster
Operator chart and their default values.

Parameter | Description | Default
--------- | ----------- | -------
`image.repository` | StorageOSCluster container image repository | `storageos/storageoscluster-operator`
`image.tag` | StorageOSCluster container image tag | `v0.0.1`
`image.pullPolicy` | StorageOSCluster container image pull policy | `IfNotPresent`
`cleanup.enable` | Enable StorageOS cleanup operator. This also requires setting `cleanupAtDelete: true` in cluster spec. | `false`
`cleanup.manager.repository` | StorageOS cleanup operator manager container image repository | `darkowlzz/daemonset-job`
`cleanup.manager.tag` | StorageOS cleanup operator manager container image tag | `v0.0.7`
`cleanup.terminator.repository` | StorageOS cleanup terminator contaimer image repository | `darkowlzz/job-terminator`
`cleanup.terminator.tag` | StorageOS cleanup terminator container image tag | `v0.0.14`


## Deleting a StorageOS Cluster

Deleting the `StorageOSCluster` custom resource object would delete the
storageos cluster and all the associated resources.

In the above example,
```
$ kubectl delete storageoscluster example-storageos
```

would delete the custom resource and the cluster.


## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```
